# Weighted Average Ensemble With DNN Models

We developed a weighted average ensemble using deep neural network models
on the diabetes dataset found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetes/data).

We applied a GridSearch on a set of pre-defined weights and found optimal weight pair to be [0.6, 0.4] with 79.22% prediction accuracy.
